      <h1>VFX</h1>
      <p>The psychology theory states that a person &#39;s retention of the concept increases by stimulating both auditory and visual senses. This is done by using the brain science of Video to tell the story to your audience and make the message stick. The presence of video in everyday life has become undeniable. With potential viewers at every computer screen, TV, digital billboard and cell phone, there is hardly a corner of the earth video cannot reach. Until just a few years ago, the methods of advancing a brand/product were pretty limited. However, since the communication and internet revolution, the ways to reach the customer have multiplied. When people retain information about who you are and what benefits you have to offer, the more likely they are to visit your website, click on a link, send you an e-mail, or give you a call. Webarch helps our project clients to communicate their messages using creative and engaging video campaigns. Our work is at the cutting edge of what &#39;s possible with video. Our team combines fresh ideas with new technology to deliver incredible viewing experiences and results.</p>

      <h1>Public Relations</h1>
      <p>
        The formal practice of what is now commonly referred to as &quot;public relations&quot;, is defined in different ways, where the ancient definition emphasized &quot;publicity&quot;, more modern definitions incorporate the concepts of &quot;engagement&quot; and &quot;relationship building.&quot; This is where we put our best foot forward and tell you things that would convince you about our writing prowess. A project &#39;s success requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of the brand or product being publicized. Today &#39;s public relations professional does much more than sit behind a desk writing content and managing it. More than ever, they are the public face who organize community outreach programs and cultivates relationships with potential clients. They hone both verbal skills and a certain level of technical understanding. Either the web technician must have sensitivity to words or the wordsmith must learn the nuts and bolts of online publishing.</p>
