<p>The psychology theory states that a person 's retention of the concept increases by stimulating both auditory and visual senses. This is done by using the brain science of Video to tell the story to your audience and make the message stick. The presence of video in everyday life has become undeniable. With potential viewers at every computer screen, TV, digital billboard and cell phone, there is hardly a corner of the earth video cannot reach. Until just a few years ago, the methods of advancing a brand/product were pretty limited. However, since the communication and internet revolution, the ways to reach the customer have multiplied. When people retain information about who you are and what benefits you have to offer, the more likely they are to visit your website, click on a link, send you an e-mail, or give you a call. Webarch helps our project clients to communicate their messages using creative and engaging video campaigns. Our work is at the cutting edge of what 's possible with video.
